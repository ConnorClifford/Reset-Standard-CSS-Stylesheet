# Reset-Standard-CSS-Stylesheet
Why should developers have to deal with hidden margins, padding and other strange defaults that interfere with good design? Sometimes this will be fine on one browser, but then another will throw you a curveball.
This can make product testing and troubleshooting difficult - much more than it has to be.

But fret no longer!

The Reset Standard Stylesheet aims to wipe the default data from all commonly used HTML elements and then redefine them in a way that does not interfere with other elements and also positions them nicely on the page. Just link it before your main .css file on your HTML page and then go to town on your styling without worry!
